# Pretrained-Transformers
Just my implementation and understanding of the transformer model and using the pretrained model


Transformers are a very exciting family of machine learning architectures. Many good tutorials exist 
(e.g. [1, 2]) but in the last few years, transformers have mostly become simpler,
so that it is now much more straightforward to explain how modern architectures work.

# Pretrained-Transformers
Just my implementation and understanding of the transformer model and using the pretrained model


Transformers are a very exciting family of machine learning architectures. Many good tutorials exist 
(e.g. [1, 2]) but in the last few years, transformers have mostly become simpler,
so that it is now much more straightforward to explain how modern architectures work.

the Two main Blog that helped me in understanding Transformer & the A.I.hacker youtube video

1. Peter Bloem's :  http://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers

2. jay alamar's :  https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/

3. The A.I. Hacker Youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bdc55j80l8

4. The Course from the huggingface also gave me some good Archi insights and great course : https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1
